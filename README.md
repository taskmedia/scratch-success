# Docker image curl-jq

This is quiet simple here - just a Docker image with curl and jq installed.

This image will build every two weeks and push it to the ghcr.io registry.

```bash
# Pull from ghcr.io (GitHub Container Registry)
docker pull ghcr.io/taskmedia/curl-jq:main

# Pull from Docker Hub
docker pull fty4/curl-jq:main
```
